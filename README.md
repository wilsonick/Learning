# Learning

I have catalogued, in this repository, my attempts to begin learning the skill of programming. 
Most of this code is written in Python, so be sure to check that out first. 
My code doesn't really do that much, but it helped me learn alot. 
I have loved science and technology all my life and started in a humble way in primary school. 
The Exp folder in my code is the most extensive.
